# Psychic-Game

This is a psychic letter guessing game where the computer randomly generates a (hidden) letter and the user has 10 tries to guess what it is. Guess the right letter and you're a winner. Choose poorly and you lose the game. The game will keep track of your wins and losses as you go so see how well of a ratio you can manage. 

The game is X-Men themed in honor of Charles Xavier's own psychic abilities.
