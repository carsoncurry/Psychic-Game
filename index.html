                Oh...My apologies, I thought for a moment that you may have been one of my students at the Xavier Institute for Gifted Youngsters. 
                My name is Professor Charles Xavier, and much like my students in the X-Men I am a mutant gifted with the ability to read the thoughts of others. 
                In fact, something is telling me that you too may possess similar psychic abilities. Perhaps a simple test could determine whether I am right or not...</p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">
                Let us begin with something simple. I will think of a single letter in the alphabet and you will try to read my thoughts to find the correct answer.
                If you can guess the letter we may even be able to find a place for you on this most uncanny team of ours.</p>
